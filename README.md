# Python Playwright MCP Testing Framework

A comprehensive Python testing framework using Playwright with Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration for automated web application and API testing.

## ðŸ¤– AI-Powered Automation

**This entire project was fully automated using AI Claude as an agent configured through the command line.**

Using Claude Code's specialized testing agents, this framework was systematically generated through:

- **Automated Project Generation**: Claude Code agents analyzed requirements and generated the complete testing infrastructure
- **Intelligent Test Creation**: Specialized agents (playwright-test-generator, playwright-api-test-creator, playwright-api-explorer) created comprehensive test suites
- **Full CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated creation of GitHub Actions workflows with security scanning, multi-browser testing, and deployment
- **Docker Integration**: Automated containerization with multi-stage builds and optimized configurations
- **Documentation Generation**: AI-generated comprehensive documentation including this README, workflow guides, and code comments

The `.claude/` directory contains the agent configurations that powered this automation, demonstrating how AI can accelerate modern software development workflows.

## Features

- **Comprehensive API Testing**: Full CRUD operations testing with sync and async support
- **UI Testing**: Web application testing with accessibility and responsive design checks
- **MCP Integration**: Specialized Claude Code agents for test generation
- **Performance Testing**: Response time monitoring and concurrent request handling
- **Cross-browser Support**: Testing across Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit
- **Visual Testing**: Screenshot and video recording capabilities
- **Flexible Configuration**: Environment-based configuration with sensible defaults

## Claude Code Agents

This project includes three specialized agents for test generation:

### 1. playwright-test-generator
Generates comprehensive Playwright tests for web applications with focus on:
- Role-based locators and semantic selectors
- Auto-retrying assertions
- Proper test structure and organization

### 2. playwright-api-test-creator
Creates API tests with full CRUD operation coverage:
- GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE operations
- Error handling and edge cases
- Authentication and authorization testing

### 3. playwright-api-explorer
Systematically explores APIs and generates comprehensive test suites:
- Resource discovery and documentation
- Test case design for all endpoints
- TypeScript test implementation

## Advanced Features

### Visual Testing
```python
# Take screenshots for visual regression testing
page.screenshot(path="test-results/screenshots/homepage.png")

# Element-specific screenshots
element.screenshot(path="test-results/screenshots/button.png")
```

### Performance Testing
```python
# Measure response times
import time
start_time = time.time()
response = api_context.get("/api/endpoint")
response_time = time.time() - start_time
assert response_time < 2.0
```

### Concurrent Testing
```python
# Test with multiple parallel requests
import threading
threads = []
for i in range(10):
    thread = threading.Thread(target=make_api_request, args=(i,))
    threads.append(thread)
    thread.start()
```
